The Robot Apocalypse Survivor System is a REST API designed to store information about survivors in a post-apocalyptic world where robots have turned against humanity. As the last survivor with coding skills, your mission is to build a system that helps manage survivors and resources.
Add survivors to the database with details such as name, age, gender, ID, and last location.
Manage survivor inventories, including resources like Water, Food, Medication, and Ammunition.
Update survivor locations easily.
Flag survivors as infected based on reports from other survivors.
